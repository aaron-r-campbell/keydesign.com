description: "An easy-to-use way to add frothy milk to your coffee"
challenge: "Can there be a good, quick and mess-free frother that goes with the milk of your choice?"
result: "The user simply fills the frother with milk, stores it in the refrigerator, and can pump it when desired to enjoy their cappuccino or latte. Because this is a new product that does not exist on the market we \"borrowed\" the well-known shape of the milk bottle to help trigger subconscious memories and ease the communication of the product's intent."
