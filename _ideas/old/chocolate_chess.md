title: "Chocolate chess inspired with legend"
description: "Souvenir box of chocolates with a fun story and experience"
challenge: "A commonly frustration is having to buy or receive a souvenir from someone. These items often just collect dust or get tossed out."
result: "This souvenir is inspired with the lovely legend of a Croatian king who played chess with an Italian king to win his freedom and the Dalmatian islands. Out of gratitude, he took the checkered board to be the Croatian coat of arms. In this chocolate version, players eat their winning chocolate figures. The crosses of the kings crown are used as a visual element for the wrapper design. This souvenir brings sweet joy home from the vacation and the chocolates are delicious!"
