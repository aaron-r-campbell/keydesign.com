title: "Chocolate 3D Printing Pen"
client:
description: "Pen that demystifies chocolate decorating by making it quick, easy and mess free."
challenge: "Decorating with melted chocolate can be a messy and intimidating process with lots of dishes to wash afterwards."
result: "Being inspired by advances in 3D printing and even chocolate 3D printing, we designed this Chocolate 3D pen. To help people understand the product's function, we used a stainless steel tip that resembles a kitchen decorating device, and chose product colors that look like dark and light chocolate. The chocolate refill is inserted into the pen's funnel top, the on/off button is pressed and the pen heats and melts the chocolate that comes out through the tip of the pen. The front is round and comfortable in the hand, while the body becomes a rounded square so it does not roll off the counter. The tip of the pen never touches the counter for better hygiene and less mess."
