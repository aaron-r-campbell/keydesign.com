description: "Dining chair combining dinning furniture aesthetics and ergonomics of good sitting."
challenge: "Bad posture affects our digestion. Dining room chairs are designed primarily with aesthetics in mind. Task chairs are built and look like ergonomic devices. The challenge was to create a chair that combined both good aesthetics and proper ergonomic support."
result: "Wave Chair is a good balance of pleasant ergonomics and dining room aesthetics. Sitting on Wave Chair decompresses the abdominal area and aides with proper digestion and enjoinment of the meal."
