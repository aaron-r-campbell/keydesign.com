client:
description: "Toy that develops the understanding and habit in children of choosing good food."
challenge: "The early years are crucial to develop taste for healthy food, but kids often don't want to eat fruits and vegetables. How can a parent develop this habit in the child?"
result: "Color-Me-Healthy is a toy designed to help children develop the understanding and habit of choosing healthy food. Every day, after each meal, the child places the colored rings that correspond to the fruits and vegetables they ate onto the stacking base. Fruits and vegetables can be sorted into 5 groups based on their color. Each group contains the pigment that has nutritional powers. It is recommended for good health to eat food from all 5 groups every day. The design for this toy is age appropriate for early childhood development, when they love routines, enjoy stacking objects, and need to learn healthy eating habits."
