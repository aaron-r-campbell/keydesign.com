ActivAngel Smart Thermometer,active,biophilia_activangel__wireless_thermometer,project,Biophilia,2018,"Consumer electronics, digital health","Smart thermometer constantly measures temperature and sends smartphone alerts, for patients, athletes and fertility purposes.","After gathering initial customer feedback and sourcing a better thermal sensor, the Stemp founder asked Keydesign to make a redesign of Stemp that would be easier to use and less costly to manufacture. Because this thermometer is worn on the body for a prolonged time, comfort, functionality and hygiene were our design focus. Regular temperature monitoring demands considerable time commitment for patients, athletes, and fertility purposes. Continuous temperature monitoring with alerts can significantly save time.","The thermometer's pebble-like design offers maximum comfort and discreet placement on the body, and the small charging port removed the need for a secondary charging sled, saving significant cost. Keydesign also designed the retail packaging to showcase the innovative monitoring solution while using minimal material usage. Continuous monitoring with smartphone alerts ensures timely updates, while the gentle, breathable adhesive maintains comfort and hygiene during extended wear.","[design research, ideation, ergonomics, 3D CAD modeling, surfacing, design for manufacturing (DFM), design documentation (tech pack), photorealistic rendering, branding and identity, packaging design]",,,,/assets/images/projects/biophilia__wireless_thermometer/h_w_biophilia.jpg,"[/assets/images/projects/biophilia__wireless_thermometer/p_w_biophilia_01.jpg, /assets/images/projects/biophilia__wireless_thermometer/p_w_biophilia_02.jpg, /assets/images/projects/biophilia__wireless_thermometer/p_w_biophilia_03.jpg, /assets/images/projects/biophilia__wireless_thermometer/p_w_biophilia_04.jpg]"

Sleep Apnea Monitor,active,somnarus__sleep_apnea_monitor,project,Somnarus,2016,"Medical devices, wearable technology",A single-use sleep apnea monitor designed to track user sleep data and store it on an memory card for physician analysis and evaluation.,"Somnarus, a medical startup, required a design for their sleep apnea wearable that would meet end-user expectations for comfort and ease-of-use. Additionally, it needed to be user-friendly for doctors and reasonably priced for manufacturing.","With the goal of one-size-fits-all usage, we started our design discovery work by building functional prototypes to test on clay models and human subjects. Through numerous iterations, we developed a range of different shapes and tested them with various adhesives on multiple face topologies. This process allowed us to discover a universal shape that provides comfortable fit for all users. The monitor is used in two ways: first by the patient at home and then by the doctor. Every element of the form has a functional or instructional reason to clearly communicate how to use it the right way. For example, the landscape orientation with small ridges on both sides informs the patient where to hold the module with both hands when attaching it on the forehead. These same markings are the guideline for the doctor to know where to cut open the module to access the internal SD card with the collected data, without damaging it during the cut.","[design research, ideation, innovation, ergonomics, user-centered design, prototyping, product testing, 3D CAD modeling, photorealistic rendering, design presentation]",,,,/assets/images/projects/somnarus__sleep_apnea_monitor/h_w_Somnarus.jpg,"[/assets/images/projects/somnarus__sleep_apnea_monitor/p_w_Somnarus_01.jpg, /assets/images/projects/somnarus__sleep_apnea_monitor/p_w_Somnarus_02.jpg, /assets/images/projects/somnarus__sleep_apnea_monitor/p_w_Somnarus_03.jpg]"
