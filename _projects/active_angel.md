title: "Wireless Thermometer"
client:
description: "Thermometer that makes monitoring fever easy by continually measuring the patients temperature and sending readings and alerts to the smart phone."
challenge: "Keydesign met the founding team of ActivAngel when they had their first generation working prototype, and they needed a consumer-ready industrial design and brand update. Comfort, functionality and hygiene were our design focus."
result: "The pebble-like feel of the thermometer most comfortably and least noticeably fits on the body where it can stay for days attached by a breathable, strong adhesive that is gentle on the skin. The second generation (top images) minimized costs and parts. The first generation (called Stemp, and successfully crowdfunded on Indiegogo) had a USB charging stick and a storage box that held all the parts (thermometer, charger and adhesives)"
