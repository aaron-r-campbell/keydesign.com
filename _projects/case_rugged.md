title: "Rugged Case with innovative protective frame"
client:
description: "Thin, stylish and inexpensive (to produce) iPhone case has unique frame design that gives strong protection to the most fragile part of the iPhone."
challenge: "The most breakable area of an iPhone is at the edges of its glass. Most of the rugged cases on the market are bulky with multiple parts or use special materials that make it expensive. The goal was to create patentable, inexpensive and slim but rugged case."
result: "We created an innovative case that has an \"air bubble\" around the edge of the glass. The impact is dispersed to the firmer areas of the phone and through the triangular pattern on the back. This creates a hidden but very powerful protection for the phone."
