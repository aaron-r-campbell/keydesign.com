title: "Fashion Handbags for Youth"
client:
description: "Fun, brightly colored, durable, waterproof and easy to keep clean bags are an ideal choice for taking it to the pool, beach or just for a walk."
challenge: "Optari wanted us to design a tote-bag inspired by the popular Crocs shoes, to be a fashion accessory for girls and young women."
result: "The design is visually very loud because these bags are bought as an accessory statement. The holes for charms allow even louder statements of the individualized style. The nature of the EVA material makes it brightly colored, durable, waterproof and easy to keep clean, an ideal bag to take wherever life takes you."
