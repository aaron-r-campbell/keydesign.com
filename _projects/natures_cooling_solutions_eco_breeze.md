description: "The first generation smart window fan. Works with existing AC units, automating the intake of fresh outdoor air. This improves indoor air quality and reduces electricity bills by decreasing AC usage during the cool season."
brief: "The client had a working prototype of a smart window fan and needed a user-friendly housing design for easy installation in standard windows that blends well with various decors."
solution: "To visually reduce the noticeable protrusion of the product's shape into the space, we chose a soft design with gentle curves. To maintain a consistent soft visual language throughout even the vent design follows this soft approach. We deliberately chose a single material and color for the entire product to minimize drawing attention to it, ensuring it blends well with various decors. The design successfully integrates with the prototype's components and is easy to install in standard windows."
