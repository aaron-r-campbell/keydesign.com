title: "Level Wallet Case"
client:
description: "Wallet case with innovative bi-material design for iPhone"
challenge: "Patchworks requested a patentable innovative wallet case design that would securely hold one, two or three credit card and all made only with two molds."
result: "We created an innovative solution by using materials properties for their best functional use. Made only with two parts, a hard PC shell and a softer TPU body. The TPU bump flexes when cards are inserted and retreats back to its original form after the cards are taken out. This innovative bump mechanism holds one, two or three cards secure with no risk of falling out. This case has everything it needs and nothing more: a win-win product both for the customer and the manufacturer."
