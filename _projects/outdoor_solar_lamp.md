title: "Outdoor morphing solar lamp"
client:
description: "A solar powered, weather-resistant light for outdoor use"
challenge: "Our client, a manufacturer of silicone LED lights, needed an innovative design for a solar powered outdoor lamp."
result: "A simple but adaptable silicone solar lamp uses the nature of silicone to be transformed to fit the need of either a tabletop or hanging lamp. Its shape resembles a hanging lantern or a candle light. To bring it closer to the customer this new kind of lamp (solar lamp) is inspired by very traditional shapes of the table candle light holders and the hanging lanterns."
