title: "American Hero Luggage Line"
description: "A line of luggage for the business traveler"
challenge: "Hartmann wanted to evolve their mature brand for a new younger audience, but keep their strong visual identity of timeless bags made of belting leather."
result: "We added a more soft-modern curved face to a very recognizable rounded rectangular shape to create a unisex feel that young urban professionals identify with."
services:
 - "market research"
 - "form exploration"
 - "2D CAD"
