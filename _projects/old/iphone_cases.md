title: "Trend-inspired fashion cases for iPhone"
description: "Samples of the fashion inspired designs for many different users styles, occasions, and price points."
challenge: "Our client needed trend-inspired fashion cases for the upcoming Apple iPhone."
result: "For Fall 2017, these case designs were inspired by new visual trends of mixing and morphing patterns to create a new made-up reality. The patterns create new layered forms and never-imagined animal prints to match timely fashion interests. The back surface of the phone was used as a canvas to create geometric and amorphous patterns that were part of fashion trends."
