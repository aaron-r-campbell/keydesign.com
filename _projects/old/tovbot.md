title: "Social Connected Robot"
description: "Shimi is a social, connected robot that plays music from your smartphone and dances along with the beat."
challenge: "Tovbot needed redesign of their initial prototype to make it more market-ready."
result: "To match the visual aesthetic more closely to the desired high-tech appeal of Shimi, we used a natural aluminum and charcoal gray (Macbook-like) paint finish with a blue glow around the main button as an indicator that the robot is on. The shape of the robot was unified and simplified using more clean geometric forms."
