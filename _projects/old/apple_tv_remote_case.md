description: "A protective and ergonomic gaming case for the Apple TV Siri Remote"
challenge: "Best Buy wanted a silicone gaming case for the Apple TV Siri remote. Siri remote's elegant and thin design needs a little more ergonomic shape if used for gaming."
result: "Clay was the most natural first choice to explore and find the best ergonomic shape for a great gaming experience. After exploring the ergonomics with clay models for a good feel, we refined the shape into a more clean and geometric form to match the simplicity of Apple's design. This new simplified shape did not compromise the ergonomic comfort of the case. In our research we found that customers complain of having a hard time finding the remote due to its size and color. We also saw that gamers like bold colors in their products, so we choose a bright red or yellow which can be easily spotted in your living room."
