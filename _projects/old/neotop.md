title: "Easy, accurate and germ-free formula dispenser"
description: "Formula dispenser that accurately pre-measures and dispenses one scoop of the formula at a time without exposing the rest of the formula to he outside germs. This product was a winner of the 2016 National Parenting Products Awards."
challenge: "A neonatology doctor approached us with the idea for a formula dispenser that would eliminate many common issues of exposing the formula to germs. Lack of hygiene is the biggest reason for formula-related mortality in third world countries."
result: "This dispenser dispenses one measure of formula at a time and eliminates the need to use a scoop, while also reducing exposure of the formula to germs in the environment. We did a deep research of the baby formula market and all other dispenser-related markets and made many variations and models to find the most ideal one that is accurate, understandable and intuitive to use."
