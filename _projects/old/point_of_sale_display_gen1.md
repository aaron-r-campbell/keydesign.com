title: "Point of Sale Display: Gen 1"
description: "Point of Sale Display for collecting user data and offering repeat-visit loyalty rewards."
challenge: "Fivestars, a software company, wanted a POS hardware system that would attract and retain customers but also be easy to setup and use by the merchant."
result: "Everything about this design is function-driven to best serve its purpose. The angled screen to better see the content, the \"framed edge\" with soft radiuses to comfortably pick up and move or just touch when using the product. Its minimal size does not take too much counter space."
services:
 - "market research"
 - "ideation"
 - "3D CAD"
