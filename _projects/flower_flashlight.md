title: "Flower Flashlight"
client:
description: "An intuitive and easy to use rechargeable night light for kids"
challenge: "Our client wanted an innovative design for a USB charging light for the saturated children's light market."
result: "This approachable and charming night-light / flashlight uses the commonly understood association of a flower and a flowerpot to inform a child of how it works. The child \"picks the flower\", uses it as a flashlight and than \"plants\" it again in its flowerpot to recharge."
