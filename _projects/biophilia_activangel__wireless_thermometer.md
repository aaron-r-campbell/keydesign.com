description: "Smart thermometer constantly measures temperature and sends smartphone alerts, for patients, athletes and fertility purposes."
brief: "After gathering initial customer feedback and sourcing a better thermal sensor, the Stemp founder asked Keydesign to make a redesign of Stemp that would be easier to use and less costly to manufacture. Because this thermometer is worn on the body for a prolonged time, comfort, functionality and hygiene were our design focus.
Regular temperature monitoring demands considerable time commitment for patients, athletes, and fertility purposes. Continuous temperature monitoring with alerts can significantly save time."
solution: "The thermometer's pebble-like design offers maximum comfort and discreet placement on the body, and the small charging port removed the need for a secondary charging sled, saving significant cost. Keydesign also designed the retail packaging to showcase the innovative monitoring solution while using minimal material usage. Continuous monitoring with smartphone alerts ensures timely updates, while the gentle, breathable adhesive maintains comfort and hygiene during extended wear."

description: "Thermometer that makes monitoring fever easy by continually measuring the patients temperature and sending readings and alerts to the smart phone."
brief: "Keydesign met the founding team of ActivAngel when they had their first generation working prototype, and they needed a consumer-ready industrial design and brand update. Comfort, functionality and hygiene were our design focus."
solution: "The pebble-like feel of the thermometer most comfortably and least noticeably fits on the body where it can stay for days attached by a breathable, strong adhesive that is gentle on the skin. The second generation (top images) minimized costs and parts. The first generation (called Stemp, and successfully crowdfunded on Indiegogo) had a USB charging stick and a storage box that held all the parts (thermometer, charger and adhesives)"
