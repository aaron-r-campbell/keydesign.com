description: "A sleek, urban rugged protective case for iPhone"
challenge: "Zuslab approached Keydesign to redesign their popular Armor Shield case, to update the styling and reduce the cost of the current multi-part construction."
result: "After working with Zuslab to determine their brand goals, and researching current trends to find marketplace fit, Keydesign created a sleek and simple two part case with various textures to highlight the functional elements of the rugged design and make it more pleasant to hold in the hand. The new design reduced manufacturing time, reduced material costs, and increased brand value to the customer."
