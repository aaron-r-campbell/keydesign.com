                <h3>Project: Easy, accurate and germ-free formula dispenser</h3>
                <p>Formula dispenser that accurately pre-measures and dispenses one scoop of the formula at a time
                    without exposing the rest of the formula to he outside germs. This product was a winner of the 2016
                    National Parenting Products Awards.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>A neonatology doctor approached us with the idea for a formula dispenser that would eliminate many
                    common issues of exposing the formula to germs. Lack of hygiene is the biggest reason for
                    formula-related mortality in third world countries.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>This dispenser dispenses one measure of formula at a time and eliminates the need to use a scoop,
                    while also reducing exposure of the formula to germs in the environment. We did a deep research of
                    the baby formula market and all other dispenser-related markets and made many variations and models
                    to find the most ideal one that is accurate, understandable and intuitive to use.
                </p>
