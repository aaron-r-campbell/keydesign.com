                <h3>Project: Sleep Apnea Monitor</h3>
                <p>A portable, single-use sleep apnea monitor for tracking user sleep data to an SD card for physican
                    use
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Somnarus needed design for their sleep apnea wearable product. It had to be consumer-focused design
                    that would meet the end user expectations for comfort and ease-of-use, while also being easy for the
                    doctor to work with, and reasonably priced for manufacturing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>Because this monitor is one-size-fits-all, the most appropriate approach to find the right design for
                    it was to start with functional prototypes. We created many different shapes and tested them with
                    many different adhesives on multiple faces to find a universal shape that comfortably fits all. The
                    monitor is used in two ways: first by the patient at his home and then by the doctor. Every element
                    of the form has a functional or instructional reason to clearly communicate how to use it the right
                    way. For example, the landscape orientation with little markings on both sides indicates to a
                    patient where to hold the module with both hands when attaching it on the forehead. These same
                    markings are the guideline for the doctor to know where to cut open the module to access the
                    internal SD card with the collected data, without damaging it during the cut.
