            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>We research, observe, and empathize to find patterns, pain points, and opportunities for users. We consider client requirements, target audience, and brand uniqueness. We stay updated on market trends and competition. By combining insights from users and clients, our goal is to create designs that meet everyone's needs. In close collaboration with the client, we use the insights gathered during the Discover phase to define opportunities and establish goals to be accomplished. This phase sets the foundation for a focused and purposeful design process.</p>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>In this phase, we generate ideas and explore different concepts to address problems and achieve goals. Sketching, brainstorming, and creating rough physical prototypes are common activities during this stage.</p>

            <h3>Conceptualize</h3>
            <p>We build 3D models of ideas from the previous phase for more precise visualization and exploration of the design. Prototyping can involve various methods such as 3D printing, laser cutting, or handcrafting.</p>
            <h3>Test</h3>
            <p>Prototypes are tested to validate the design. This iterative process helps us identify any potential issues and allows us to make improvements and refinements to ensure the final design meets the functionality and user satisfaction.</p>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>The final 3D CAD is made based on user feedback and evaluation results. This model is built with great attention to detail, proportions, manufacturability, and functionality, making it both aesthetically well balanced and user-friendly. The photo-realistic renderings are made to fully convey colors, materials, and finishes of the final product. Detailed documentations (tech-pack) are created to communicate the design requirements to manufacturers and other stakeholders involved in production.</p>

            <h3>Collaborate</h3>
            <p>This is the phase of iterative feedback loops and collaboration with engineers and manufacturers to ensure the design intent is maintained throughout the manufacturing process. This collaborative effort ensures that the product can be cost-effectively produced while maintaining its aesthetic appeal.</p>
            <h3>Support</h3>
            <p>We remain involved throughout the process, verifying the intended design until the product is shipped. This may include tasks such as production supervision and quality inspection to ensure that the manufactured products meet the required standards and specifications.</p>
